# To-Do List

 ***Introduction***
  I've always used to-do lists, and since I didn't knew what to do as my first Dart/Flutter independent project, I've chosen to create my own to-do list app, so, here it is. It's very simple but it helped me to understand and put into practice a lot of things I've only learned thorugh theory or coding along with coruses.
 
 ***Features***
  - Users can create their own tasks by clicking on the '+' buttons.
  - You can mark a task as done by cliking on it (check it).
  - When creating a task you may choose to add a deadline, including only a date or a date and a time.
  - You can edit tasks by clicking on the pen button.
  - You can delete a task by sliding it from right to left.
 
 ***Possible features***
  - User could add more than one list.
  - User could receive a push-up when a task is expired.
  - Users could change the color scheme of the app.
